Two's complement allows negative and positive numbers to be added together without any special logic. 
This means that subtraction and addition of both positive and negative numbers can all be done by the same circuit in the cpu.
In two's complement form, a negative number is the 2's complement of its positive number with the subtraction of two numbers being A â€“ B = A + ( 2's complement of B ) using much the same process as before as basically, two's complement is one's complement + 1.
