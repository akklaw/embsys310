Another example could be "network switch"

netowrk switch allows you to connect computers.  The network switch must receive data from uplink port and forward data to
destination port.  Altneratively the data would flow from one of the ports to uplink port.

Development Challenges:

Throughput - Handling a lot of data in a short time
Response - Reacting to events "quickly"
Testablility - difficulties in settting up equipment to test embedded software.
Debugability - No screen and no keyboard
Reliability - No human intervent once deployed
Memory space - limited memory
Program installation and upgrade - special tools to install and upgrade the software
